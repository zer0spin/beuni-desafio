## üîç Technical Implementation

### Test Infrastructure
- **Mock Factory Pattern:** `createMockPrismaService()` for test isolation
- **Fixture System:** Comprehensive test data factories for all entities
- **Date Handling:** Fixed date mocking for consistent birthday calculations
- **Error Scenarios:** Extensive error handling and edge case coverage
- **Async Operations:** Proper handling of promises and transactions

### Key Technical Achievements
1. **Timezone Issue Resolution:** Fixed complex date calculation bugs in birthday notifications
2. **Mock Injection Patterns:** Implemented direct service instantiation for better control
3. **Transaction Testing:** Comprehensive database transaction and rollback testing
4. **Cache Integration:** Redis cache mocking and performance testing
5. **API Integration:** External service mocking (ViaCEP) with error simulation

### Testing Challenges Resolved
- **Date Calculation Precision:** Resolved timezone-related issues in birthday calculations
- **Mock Consistency:** Implemented factory pattern to prevent mock pollution
- **Complex Business Logic:** Comprehensive testing of holiday and business day algorithms
- **Service Dependencies:** Proper mocking of inter-service dependencies
