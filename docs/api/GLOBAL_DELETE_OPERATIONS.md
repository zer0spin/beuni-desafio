# Global Delete Operations - Feature Documentation

> **Last Updated**: October 4, 2025  
> **Status**: Production Ready  
> **Impact**: High - Critical Data Management Operations

---

## üìã Overview

This document covers the comprehensive global delete functionality implemented across the Beuni platform, enabling administrators to perform bulk data cleanup operations with proper safeguards and user confirmations.

---

## üéØ Features Implemented

### 1. Global Shipment Deletion
**Endpoint**: `DELETE /envio-brindes/delete-all`

#### Functionality
- Deletes ALL shipment records for the authenticated organization
- Maintains organization isolation for multi-tenant security
- Returns deletion count for audit purposes
- Preserves collaborator data (shipments only)

#### Technical Implementation
```typescript
async deleteAllShipments(organizationId: string) {
  const result = await this.prisma.envioBrinde.deleteMany({
    where: {
      colaborador: {
        organizationId,
      },
    },
  });

  return {
    message: 'All shipments deleted successfully',
    deletedCount: result.count,
  };
}
```

### 2. Global Collaborator Deletion
**Endpoint**: `DELETE /colaboradores`

#### Functionality
- Deletes ALL collaborators for the authenticated organization
- Cascades to delete related shipment records automatically
- Maintains referential integrity through database constraints
- Returns deletion count for audit tracking

#### Technical Implementation
```typescript
async removeAll(organizationId: string) {
  const result = await this.prisma.colaborador.deleteMany({
    where: {
      organizationId,
    },
  });

  return {
    message: 'All colaboradores deleted successfully',
    deletedCount: result.count,
  };
}
```

## üîí Security & Safety Measures

### Organization Isolation
- All delete operations are scoped to the authenticated user's organization
- Cross-organization data access is impossible
- Prisma queries enforce organization-level filtering

### Authentication Requirements
- JWT authentication required for all endpoints
- User context provides organization scope automatically
- No anonymous or cross-organization operations allowed

### Database Integrity
- Foreign key constraints ensure referential integrity
- Cascade deletes handled at database level for related records
- Transaction-based operations prevent partial failures

---

## üé® User Interface Implementation

### Bulk Shipment Modal
**Component**: `BulkShipmentModal.tsx`

#### Features
- Dual-purpose modal for create and delete operations
- Step-by-step confirmation process
- Clear danger warnings for destructive operations
- Loading states with disabled interactions

#### User Flow - Delete Operation
1. **Initial View**: User sees "Deletar Todos" button
2. **Confirmation Screen**: Shows warning message with action details
3. **Final Confirmation**: Large, clearly marked danger button
4. **Processing**: Loading state with disabled controls
5. **Completion**: Success feedback and data refresh

#### Warning Messages
```typescript
‚ö†Ô∏è PERIGO: Deletar TODOS os Envios

Esta a√ß√£o deletar√° TODOS os registros de envio de TODOS os anos 
e TODOS os colaboradores da organiza√ß√£o.

Esta a√ß√£o N√ÉO PODE ser desfeita.
```

### Collaborator Delete Modal
**Page**: `colaboradores/index.tsx`

#### Features
- Dedicated "Deletar Todos" button in collaborator management
- Modal confirmation with cascade deletion warnings
- Clear indication of data that will be affected
- Post-deletion data refresh

#### User Flow
1. **Access**: Button clearly labeled "Deletar Todos"
2. **Warning Modal**: Detailed explanation of cascade effects
3. **Confirmation**: Explicit confirmation required
4. **Execution**: Visual feedback during operation
5. **Refresh**: Automatic page refresh showing empty state

## üìä API Responses

### Successful Deletion Response
```json
{
  "message": "All shipments deleted successfully",
  "deletedCount": 147
}
```

### Error Response Format
```json
{
  "statusCode": 400,
  "message": "Bad Request",
  "error": "Organization context required"
}
```

---

## üß™ Testing Coverage

### Backend Tests

#### Service Layer Testing
- Organization isolation verification
- Empty state handling (0 records)
- Large dataset deletion (1000+ records)
- Error propagation testing
- Mock verification for Prisma calls

#### Controller Testing
- Authentication guard enforcement
- User context requirement validation
- Error handling and HTTP status codes
- Response format verification

### Frontend Tests

#### Component Testing
- Modal rendering and state management
- User interaction flows (click, cancel, confirm)
- Loading state handling
- Error message display
- Button state management (enabled/disabled)

#### Integration Testing
- API call verification
- Data refresh after operations
- Error handling with user feedback
- Navigation flow testing

## ‚ö° Performance Considerations

### Database Operations
- Bulk delete operations use `deleteMany` for efficiency
- Organization-scoped queries minimize data scanning
- Database indexes optimize deletion performance
- Cascade deletes handled at database level

### Frontend Optimization
- Loading states prevent multiple submissions
- Disabled states during operations
- Optimistic UI updates where appropriate
- Minimal re-renders during state changes

---

## üîç Monitoring & Auditing

### Deletion Tracking
- All operations return deletion counts
- Success/failure status tracked in application logs
- Organization context logged for audit trails
- Timestamp information available in logs

### Error Monitoring
- Database errors captured and logged
- Authentication failures tracked
- Rate limiting applied to prevent abuse
- User action patterns monitored

---

## üöÄ Deployment Considerations

### Database Migrations
- No schema changes required for core functionality
- Existing foreign key constraints support cascade operations
- Index optimization may be needed for large datasets

### Environment Configuration
- No additional configuration required
- Existing authentication system handles authorization
- Monitoring dashboards should track bulk operations

### Rollback Procedures
- No automatic rollback for deletion operations
- Data restoration requires backup recovery
- Clear warnings prevent accidental operations

---

## üìã Usage Guidelines

### When to Use Global Delete
- **Development/Testing**: Cleaning test data
- **Data Migration**: Preparing for system migrations
- **Organization Cleanup**: Removing all data before closure
- **Fresh Start**: Resetting organization data

### When NOT to Use
- **Partial Cleanup**: Use individual delete operations
- **Production Maintenance**: Consider archiving instead
- **Regular Operations**: Not intended for routine data management
- **Uncertain Scenarios**: Always verify data backup first

---

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "No Records Deleted" (Count: 0)
- Verify organization has data to delete
- Check authentication and organization context
- Confirm user permissions

#### Timeout Errors
- Large datasets may require increased timeout limits
- Consider implementing progress indicators for very large operations
- Monitor database performance during operations

#### Partial Deletion Failures
- Database constraints may prevent some deletions
- Check for orphaned records or constraint violations
- Review application logs for specific error details

---

## üìà Future Enhancements

### Planned Improvements
1. **Progress Indicators**: Real-time deletion progress for large datasets
2. **Backup Integration**: Automatic backup creation before deletion
3. **Selective Deletion**: Date range or criteria-based bulk operations
4. **Audit Logging**: Enhanced logging with user attribution

### Potential Extensions
1. **Soft Delete Option**: Mark records as deleted instead of permanent removal
2. **Scheduled Deletions**: Time-based automatic cleanup
3. **Batch Processing**: Chunked deletion for very large datasets
4. **Recovery Tools**: Undo functionality with temporary retention
