    participant User
    participant AuthService
    participant TokenManager
    participant Database

    User->>AuthService: Login Credentials
    AuthService->>Database: Verify Credentials
    Database-->>AuthService: Credentials Valid
    AuthService->>TokenManager: Generate JWT
    TokenManager-->>User: Secure httpOnly Cookie
    User->>AuthService: Subsequent Requests
    AuthService->>TokenManager: Validate Token
    TokenManager-->>AuthService: Token Valid
    AuthService-->>User: Grant Access
```

### Security Configuration
- **Authentication**:
  - JWT with 1-hour expiration
  - Refresh token mechanism
  - httpOnly secure cookies

- **Network Security**:
  - HTTPS enforced
  - Strict CORS policies
  - Web Application Firewall (WAF)

- **Data Protection**:
  - AES-256 encryption for sensitive data
  - Secure key management
  - Regular key rotation
