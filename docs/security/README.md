## üö® Incident Response Quick Reference

### Emergency Contacts

- **Security Team**: security@beuni.com
- **Incident Response**: incident@beuni.com
- **Response Time**: 48 hours for initial response

### Incident Classification

| Level | Description | Response Time | Escalation |
|-------|-------------|---------------|------------|
| **Level 1 (Low)** | Minor vulnerability, no active exploit | 24-48 hours | Team Lead |
| **Level 2 (Medium)** | Potential active exploit, limited impact | 4-12 hours | Security Team |
| **Level 3 (High)** | Active exploit, significant risk | 1-4 hours | CISO, Legal |
| **Level 4 (Critical)** | Major breach, data compromise | Immediate | Executive, Legal, Forensics |

### Immediate Response Steps

1. **Identify and validate** the incident
2. **Isolate** affected systems
3. **Preserve** forensic evidence
4. **Contain** the threat
5. **Eradicate** root cause
6. **Recover** systems safely
7. **Document** lessons learned

## ‚úÖ Production Deployment Checklist

### Pre-Deployment Security Verification

- [ ] Generate strong JWT secret: `openssl rand -hex 32`
- [ ] Verify all environment variables configured
- [ ] Run security tests: `npm run test:security`
- [ ] Deploy updated dependencies (2025-10-04 versions)
- [ ] Verify no hardcoded secrets in code

### Post-Deployment Verification

- [ ] Verify HTTPS/TLS active
- [ ] Test authentication flow end-to-end
- [ ] Monitor security event logs
- [ ] Verify rate limiting active
- [ ] Test CORS configuration
- [ ] Validate CSP headers
