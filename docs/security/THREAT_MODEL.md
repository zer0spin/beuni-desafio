## 4. Threat Analysis (STRIDE)

### 4.1 Spoofing Threats
#### Identified Risks
- Weak JWT secret management
- Potential token hijacking
- Insufficient identity verification

#### Mitigation Strategies
- Use strong, randomly generated JWT secret
- Implement token rotation
- Add multi-factor authentication
- Short token expiration times

### 4.2 Tampering Threats
#### Identified Risks
- Potential parameter manipulation
- Client-side data modification
- Unauthorized data updates

#### Mitigation Strategies
- Strict server-side input validation
- Implement comprehensive authorization checks
- Use parameterized queries with Prisma
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs

### 4.3 Repudiation Threats
#### Identified Risks
- Insufficient audit logging
- No non-repudiation mechanisms
- Limited transaction traceability

#### Mitigation Strategies
- Implement comprehensive logging
- Store detailed user action logs
- Create immutable audit trail
- Log authentication events, data modifications

### 4.4 Information Disclosure
#### Identified Risks
- Potential sensitive data exposure
- Inadequate error handling
- Risk of leaking system information

#### Mitigation Strategies
- Remove detailed error messages in production
- Implement proper access controls
- Use principle of least privilege
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
- Mask/truncate sensitive information

### 4.5 Denial of Service
#### Identified Risks
- Unprotected API endpoints
- Potential brute-force attacks
- Resource exhaustion vulnerabilities

#### Mitigation Strategies
- Implement rate limiting
- Use request throttling
- Add IP-based request tracking
- Configure maximum request sizes
- Implement connection timeout mechanisms

### 4.6 Elevation of Privilege
#### Identified Risks
- Weak role-based access control
- Potential unauthorized role manipulation
- Insufficient permission validation

#### Mitigation Strategies
- Implement strict RBAC
- Validate user permissions server-side
- Create granular permission models
- Regular permission audits
